==================
=  Description:  =
==================

Using classes and objects we built a program that runs the famous asteroid
game.
The different objects in the game such as the ship, the asteroids and the
torpedoes were all of different class with different qualities and functions
that they were capable of preforming.
We used the main python file "asteroids_main" to get the interactions
between the different class objects to work.

======================

3 things to consider while writing the game:

1) MOVE FUNCTION - we could write this function independently for each class or
 under the "asteroids_main" file.
 We chose to write it once under the "asteroids_main" file since it works and
 applies the same calculation for all objects so under the main file we could
 apply one function to move all 3 game objects.

2) DELETE ASTEROID/TORPEDO - The delete functions are 2 lines long. We could
   have added them under the different collision function or write 2 extra
   functions. We chose to write a unique function to delete asteroids and a
   unique function to delete torpedoes since this way the code looks better and
   seems more organized. This way in the main collision functions we added one
   line each time instead of 3 and kept it shorter.

3) KEYBOARD ACTION - To check the different keyboard action done by the player
   we could write a specific function for each action. Since the code works in
   a "passive" way, each loops has only one action updated. Because of this, we
   decided to check all possibilities for keyboard action in a single function
   that runs once in every game loop and can update 1 movement each time.
   This way, our game loop function runs through less functions to check every
   time it runs and for that reason it is faster and less complex.
